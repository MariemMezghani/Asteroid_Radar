# Overview:

Asteroid Radar is an app to view the asteroids detected by NASA that pass near Earth, 
you can view all the detected asteroids given a period of time with data such as the size, velocity, distance to earth and if they are potentially hazardous. 
The resulting output of the project is two screens: a Main screen with a list of all the detected asteroids and a Details screen that displays the data of that asteroid once 
itÂ´s selected in the Main screen list. The main screen shows the NASA image of the day to make the app more striking.
